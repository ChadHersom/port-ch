	<h2><i>Summary</i></h2>
	<p>Building webpages and manipulating HTML and CSS has been an occasional hobby of mine for about 15 years. I am self taught using online resources and through basically trial and error. I started learning Javascript and other programming languages in 2017 just for fun and I enjoy writing scripts and finding solutions to problems. I'm a journeyman electrician by trade, but I would like to pursue a career in web development and I'm confident that I can bring value to a company or team if given the opportunity.</p>
	<h2><i>Experience</i></h2>
<ul>
	<li><b>Personal Projects</b></li>
<br>
	<ol>
		<li>This resume was built entirely from scratch using HTML, CSS, and a little Javascript.</li>
	</ol>
<br>
	<li><b>Journeyman Electrician</b></li>
	<p>I'm aware that electrical work and software programming are very different lines of work. However, I believe the troubleshooting and problem solving skills I have learned as an electrician are not only applicable to web development, but extremely valuable moving forwards into the future.</p>
